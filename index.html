    <p>The <em>Black Panther</em> is <strong>awesome</strong> because it's extremely good at hunting.<br>
      It has the ability to blend into the darkness and stalk it's prey with incredible stealth. The black panther is also incredibly strong and athetlic, being able to jump from trees and climb them.
